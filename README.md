# Tools

## EA DLC Unlocker v2
`EA DLC Unlocker v2.zip`

With this tool you can unlock DLCs for your legit game. Some DLCs require additional files. You won't be able to download them through Origin/EA app/Steam (unless you actually buy them).

### Installation instructions:
0. Download and extract EA DLC Unlocker.
1. Run "setup.bat". (Special note for Sims players since I'm tired of hearing "but how do I run the setup.bat file?" - the same way you run any program or game on your PC - by double clicking on it. It may be displayed as just "setup".)
2. Select "Install" to install the Unlocker. The script automatically detects if you have EA app or Origin installed. If you have both it will detect EA app only and game started from Origin won't have the DLCs unlocked! If this happens reinstall Origin and run the script again or use the manual installation instructions in the readme file.
3. Select "Add/Update game config" and select the game.
4. Download DLC files if needed - see the links below. (Special note for Sims players - YES, you need the DLC files. DLC Unlocker doesn't download anything.)

If your DLCs suddenly stop working - it's because EA app updated and removed the DLC Unlocker. So simply install it again.

## Remid cookie grabber
`remid-cookie-grabber.7z`
`remid_cookie_grabber.exe.7z`

Tool for Windows, for grabbing remid cookie needed to log into the online module for Origin Emulator. Currently used in The Sims 4 crack only. I can't be bothered to update the instructions in the emulator - it will point to a deleted github page. Same for the video instructions - deleted video. Oh well...

## Sims related UserScripts
`sims-userscripts.7z`

These were made to make downloading from The Sims Resource, Sims Finds, Patreon and Around The Sims easier. Previously shared only on two Discord servers, now out in the open. Read the markdown file (.md) for installation instructions.

## EA Get Token
`ea-get-token.7z`
`get_token.exe.7z`

Windows tool for getting the auth token from EA app. Made for Origin Helper.

## TS1 and TS2 launchers
`TS-helper-tools.7z`

Launchers for The Sims 1 and 2 Legacy Editions. They set the necessary registry keys and let you change the language.

## Patcher
`patcher.7z`

A tool for making and applying patches. This is what Updater was using under the hood.

## Other Sims 4 stuff
`ts4installer-tumblr-files.7z`
`sims-4-tools.7z`

These two repositories were interlinked. One has old files I used on my first website - my tumblr page. That includes UserScripts for downloading from TS4 gallery and TS3 exchange, tumblr page template, file hashes and validator's main brains. The other one contains validator HTML page, event unlocker page, gallery downloader page, dlc toggler, dlc uninstaller, language changer, scripts for listing sims folders, and more.

## Python scripts for ZIP files
`misc_python_scripts.7z`

One is for extracting ZIP files from the end - useful when you don't have enough space to keep the archive and extracted files at the same time. The other one extends/fixes zipfile module from Python.

## EA library in Python
`ea.7z`

It's a Python library for interacting with EA API. Logging in with remid cookie, grabbing list of your games, grabbing info about game, grabbing download link...
