# Tools

## EA DLC Unlocker v2
`EA DLC Unlocker v2.zip`
`EA DLC Unlocker for Mac.zip`

With this tool you can unlock DLCs for your legit game. Some DLCs require additional files. You won't be able to download them through Origin/EA app/Steam (unless you actually buy them).

## Remid cookie grabber
`remid-cookie-grabber.7z`
`remid_cookie_grabber.exe.7z`

Tool for Windows, for grabbing remid cookie needed to log into the online module for Origin Emulator. Currently used in The Sims 4 crack only. I can't be bothered to update the instructions in the emulator - it will point to a deleted github page. Same for the video instructions - deleted video. Oh well...

## Sims related UserScripts
`sims-userscripts.7z`

These were made to make downloading from The Sims Resource, Sims Finds, Patreon and Around The Sims easier. Previously shared only on two Discord servers, now out in the open. Read the markdown file (.md) for installation instructions.

## EA Get Token
`ea-get-token.7z`
`get_token.exe.7z`

Windows tool for getting the auth token from EA app. Made for Origin Helper.

## TS1 and TS2 launchers
`TS-helper-tools.7z`

Launchers for The Sims 1 and 2 Legacy Editions. They set the necessary registry keys and let you change the language.

## Patcher
`patcher.7z`

A tool for making and applying patches. This is what Updater was using under the hood.

## Other Sims 4 stuff
`ts4installer-tumblr-files.7z`
`sims-4-tools.7z`

These two repositories were interlinked. One has old files I used on my first website - my tumblr page. That includes UserScripts for downloading from TS4 gallery and TS3 exchange, tumblr page template, file hashes and validator's main brains. The other one contains validator HTML page, event unlocker page, gallery downloader page, dlc toggler, dlc uninstaller, language changer, scripts for listing sims folders, and more.

## Python scripts for ZIP files
`misc_python_scripts.7z`

One is for extracting ZIP files from the end - useful when you don't have enough space to keep the archive and extracted files at the same time. The other one extends/fixes zipfile module from Python.

## EA library in Python
`ea.7z`

It's a Python library for interacting with EA API. Logging in with remid cookie, grabbing list of your games, grabbing info about game, grabbing download link...
